A Simple Unix Shell
## Unix Shell
A unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is operates as both an interactive command language and a scripting language. It is controlled by the operating system for execution using shell scripts.
## Overview
This shell is minimalistic, yet includes the basic functionality of a traditional unix command line user-interface.

This project consists of files (a header file, functions files, readme, and author) created on a vagrant virtual machine box. Vi text editor was used to write the scripts, while gcc compiler was used to compile the codes.

A simple shell was created using the C-Programming language.
